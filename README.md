# BerLean 2

This repo contains material for a talk to be held at Humbold Universit√§t Berlin.
It contains:
- A short introduction to linked lists
- A little illustration on the difference between verifying algorithms and algorithms that produce proofs
- An implementation of subgradient descent and a proof that it does indeed descend under the right conditions
